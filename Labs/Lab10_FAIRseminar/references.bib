abstract={Software development for data reduction and analysis at large research facilities is increasingly professionalized, and internationally coordinated. To foster software quality and sustainability, and to facilitate collaboration, representatives from software groups of European neutron and muon facilities have agreed on a set of guidelines for development practices, infrastructure, and functional and non-functional product properties. These guidelines have been derived from actual practices in software projects from the EU funded consortium `Science and Innovation with Neutrons in Europe in 2020' (SINE2020), and have been enriched through extensive literature review. Besides guiding the work of the professional software engineers in our computing groups, we hope to influence scientists who are willing to contribute their own data treatment software to our community. Moreover, this work may also provide inspiration to scientific software development beyond the neutron and muon field.},
